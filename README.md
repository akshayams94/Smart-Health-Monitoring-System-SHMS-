The Smart Health Monitoring System (SHMS) is a comprehensive platform that allows users to monitor and track vital health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.) from different devices like wearable gadgets and manual input. The system processes this data to give actionable insights, warning signals in case of abnormal readings, and suggests lifestyle changes.

Users can also share this data with their healthcare providers, who can monitor it remotely and provide guidance in real-time, making the platform an ideal solution for both individuals and medical professionals.
